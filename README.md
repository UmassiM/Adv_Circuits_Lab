# Adv_Circuits_Lab
Some old reports on our Advanced Circuits Lab experiences while Undergraduates.\
These include the use of basic circuit components as well as the integration of semiconductors, microprocessors, gates etc.\
The main tools used to study such circuits and their behavior are, of course, oscilloscopes, set in various configurations according to demand.
